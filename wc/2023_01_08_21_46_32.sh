Did you know you can use the WC command in Linux? It's a great way to count the number of words, lines, and characters in a file! Just run `wc <filename>` to get started. #Linux #CommandLine #WC

# Use the WC command to count the number of words, lines, and characters in a file
wc <filename>
# The output is the number of lines, words, and characters in the file, in that order.
